vimrc
=====

*vimrc.basics

This is the least settings based on Vim builtin features and I think I feel the best. It is to avoid using of any plugins or external dependencies. The original idea is from provided copy from vimgolf.com .
I'll be updating it if any new idea.

*vimrc.full

This is for a copy for plain text and code editing, without limits on plugins.
